# June-Starter-Friendship
This project is a starter to help keep track social connections and I will be making changes along the way 


# What the ideas is about

With summer upcoming, I thought it'll be good to connect with friends that I haven't met in a long time, but with so much time has passed. I happen to be a little anxious to know what my friends have been up to. Therefore, I thought about tracking details about my contacts and provides recommended sharable content hobbies using newsapi based on their interests. Using this as a start, then I can share news about common hobbies to my friends and keep track important details about them. I currently have only made a prototype for the design and many implementation features are still  in progress.
